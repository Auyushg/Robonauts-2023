This is a repository of the programs that I contributed to on the Robonauts 2023 Robot "Echo" - Code bases for the robot can be found on the website https://www.118robonauts.org/robots.

I was a part of the End Effector for the Robot - the part that picks up cones and inflatable cubes from the robot's intake. This was my first experience with programming!
